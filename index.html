<!-- 

user lands on page
prompts to user to enter birth month, day, and year  
via three separate fields 
behind the scenes using javascript, we will convert those three fields into a userDate string. 
-- this birthdate gets stored in a variable called userDate 

prompt the user to select a "section" or "random"
this will be stored in a variable called userSectionChoice 


then, an api call to NYT article search, with the userDate as the begin_date and end_date
this will isolate for articles that were released on the user's birthdate 
the section will be used to sort through the array, and we will isolate for the articles that are part of the section that he user selects 

then, randomly generate OR take the first three (undecided) articles to display on the page
